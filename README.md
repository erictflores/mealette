Mealette is a fully functional webapp MVP that I built with three other students at Dev Bootcamp.

We pair-programmed for about 100 hours over 7 days and presented our final project on graduation day.

Functionality
------------
Mealette makes it simple and easy for you to find a great restaurant to try out whenever you're in a new city (or a new part of town).

Mealette utilizes a user's location and loads the top rated restaurants from Yelp onto a carousel.

A user is then able to swipe through the restaurant options one by one, or hit a button that spins the carousel to randomly land on one of the 10 restaurants.

A user is also able to access the restaurant's Yelp page, and get directions to the location using Google Maps.
